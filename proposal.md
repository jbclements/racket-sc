## Draft of Proposal
 
 
I'm planning on writing a client for the SuperCollider (SC) music synthesis server for use in the Music Programming section of CSC123.
Currently students in CSC123 use Racket (programming language and environment) and libraries (rsound) to create sounds using basic signal processing operations, but they can't easily use more advanced features.
Using the new interface to SuperCollider, students will have easier access to sophisticated real-time synthesis techniques.
 
Also, I may develop some labs using the SuperCollider interface.

Things I need to do:

Different parts of racket-sc:
* interface with racket (How it will look for CSC123 students)
* interface with SC

* documentation of 
* code as an rsound extention
* tests
    - How could I test this?

## Winter Quarter 2014
- Weeks 1: Read references (SuperCollider manuals and book) and get more familiar with SuperCollider and existing alternative clients (overtone)
- Week  2, 3: See how Overtone interacts with SC and explore the feasibility of porting some of overtone to Racket
- Week 4, 5: Begin a prototype in racket that implements few features of the full interface
- Week 6: Create specification and documentation of the interface with racket and SC
- Week 7: Devise methods and automated tests to test various functionalities
- Week 8-10: Implement some of the new specified elements
 
## Spring Quarter 2014
Weeks:
- 1, 2: Based on the first cycle, revise specification and design choices
- 3, 4: 
- 5, 6, 7: complete program
- 8: 
- 9: complete project and submit to senior project advisor for review.
- 10: submit final copy to senior project advisor.
