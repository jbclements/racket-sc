## Proposal
 
 
I'm planning on writing a client for the SuperCollider (SC) music synthesis server for use in the Music Programming section of CSC123. Currently, students in CSC123 use Racket (programming language and environment) and libraries (rsound) to create sounds using basic signal processing operations, but they donâ€™t have access to a wide variety of sound design techniques. Using the new interface to SuperCollider, students will have easier access to sophisticated real-time synthesis techniques. Also, I will develop 2 or 3 labs for CSC123 using the SuperCollider interface.



### Winter Quarter 2014

Features

- Week 2: Implement starting the server from Racket
- Week 3-4: Generate SynthDef files and send them to the server. (SynthDefs specify networked Unit Generators)
- Week 5: Controling and sending messages to nodes (Unit Generators, synths)
- Week 6-10: Implement more features of the full SC interface (control flow, sequencing)

### Spring Quarter 2014

-	Week 1, 2: Create few labs or assignments that involve the SC interface
-	Week 3-4: Test cross-platform compatibility
-	Week 5: Revise documentation
-	Week 6-9: complete project and submit to senior project advisor for review.
-	10: submit final copy to senior project advisor.
