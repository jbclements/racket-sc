## Draft of Proposal
 
 
I'm planning on writing a client for the SuperCollider music synthesis server for use in the Music Programming section of CSC123.
Currently students in CSC123 use Racket (programming language and environment) and libraries (rsound) to create sounds using basic signal processing operations, but they can't easily use more advanced features.
Using the new interface to SuperCollider, students will have easier access to sophisticated real-time synthesis techniques.
 
Also, I may develop some labs using the SuperCollider interface.
 
 
## Winter Quarter 2014
 
- Weeks 1: Read references (SuperCollider manuals and book) and get more familiar with SuperCollider and existing alternative clients (overtone)
- Week  2: Explore the feasability of porting some of overtone to Racket
- Weeks 3-4: 
- Week 4-7: Begin program in racket to analyze
- Week 8: 
 
- Week 9,10: 
 
## Spring Quarter 2014
